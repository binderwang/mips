- Removed loop from sampling functions and almost all algorithms. `bsxfun` and vectorization is used whenever possible. This allows for much faster computation, especially when few cores are available.
- ReLe is no longer needed as `collect_samples` and step-based approaches are faster.
- Added several MDPs. MDPs are now better organized in objects.
- Policies are better organized.
- Scrips for setting up experiments are separated from the learning ones.
- Still need to add some stuff and to check for possible bugs.
- Removed dependencies from the Statistics Toolbox.
